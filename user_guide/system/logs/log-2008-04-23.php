			<h2>Why might you require one? </h2>

			<p>You may require one following unfavourable mortgage valuation, Homebuyer Survey, building survey or property overview.</p>

			<p>A hardcore containing sulphate is now banned from use below floor slabs, and in any case there is now a requirement for a damp proof membrane which would prevent sulphate attack. Typically the problem houses are those built by local authorities in the 1950?s and 60?s in mining areas. This is because colliery shale, which contains sulphates, was used for hardcore.</p>

			<h2>What does a Sulphate Report entail? </h2>

			<p>A sulphate report entails breaking one or more holes through the ground floor slab and digging down to determine the hardcore thickness. A sample may then be taken for laboratory analysis.</p>

			<h2>Why might you require one? </h2>

			<p>You may require one following unfavourable mortgage valuation, Homebuyer Survey, building survey or property overview.</p>

			<p>A hardcore containing sulphate is now banned from use below floor slabs, and in any case there is now a requirement for a damp proof membrane which would prevent sulphate attack. Typically the problem houses are those built by local authorities in the 1950?s and 60?s in mining areas. This is because colliery shale, which contains sulphates, was used for hardcore.</p>

			<h2>What does a Sulphate Report entail? </h2>

			<p>A sulphate report entails breaking one or more holes through the ground floor slab and digging down to determine the hardcore thickness. A sample may then be taken for laboratory analysis.</p>

			<h2>Why might you require one? </h2>

			<p>You may require one following unfavourable mortgage valuation, Homebuyer Survey, building survey or property overview.</p>

			<p>A hardcore containing sulphate is now banned from use below floor slabs, and in any case there is now a requirement for a damp proof membrane which would prevent sulphate attack. Typically the problem houses are those built by local authorities in the 1950?s and 60?s in mining areas. This is because colliery shale, which contains sulphates, was used for hardcore.</p>

			<h2>What does a Sulphate Report entail? </h2>

			<p>A sulphate report entails breaking one or more holes through the ground floor slab and digging down to determine the hardcore thickness. A sample may then be taken for laboratory analysis.</p>

			<h2>Why might you require one? </h2>

			<p>You may require one following unfavourable mortgage valuation, Homebuyer Survey, building survey or property overview.</p>

			<p>A hardcore containing sulphate is now banned from use below floor slabs, and in any case there is now a requirement for a damp proof membrane which would prevent sulphate attack. Typically the problem houses are those built by local authorities in the 1950?s and 60?s in mining areas. This is because colliery shale, which contains sulphates, was used for hardcore.</p>

			<h2>What does a Sulphate Report entail? </h2>

			<p>A sulphate report entails breaking one or more holes through the ground floor slab and digging down to determine the hardcore thickness. A sample may then be taken for laboratory analysis.</p>

			<h2>Why might you require one? </h2>

			<p>You may require one following unfavourable mortgage valuation, Homebuyer Survey, building survey or property overview.</p>

			<p>A hardcore containing sulphate is now banned from use below floor slabs, and in any case there is now a requirement for a damp proof membrane which would prevent sulphate attack. Typically the problem houses are those built by local authorities in the 1950?s and 60?s in mining areas. This is because colliery shale, which contains sulphates, was used for hardcore.</p>

			<h2>What does a Sulphate Report entail? </h2>

			<p>A sulphate report entails breaking one or more holes through the ground floor slab and digging down to determine the hardcore thickness. A sample may then be taken for laboratory analysis.</p>

			<h2>Why might you require one? </h2>

			<p>You may require one following unfavourable mortgage valuation, Homebuyer Survey, building survey or property overview.</p>

			<p>A hardcore containing sulphate is now banned from use below floor slabs, and in any case there is now a requirement for a damp proof membrane which would prevent sulphate attack. Typically the problem houses are those built by local authorities in the 1950?s and 60?s in mining areas. This is because colliery shale, which contains sulphates, was used for hardcore.</p>

			<h2>What does a Sulphate Report entail? </h2>

			<p>A sulphate report entails breaking one or more holes through the ground floor slab and digging down to determine the hardcore thickness. A sample may then be taken for laboratory analysis.</p>

			<h2>Why might you require one? </h2>

			<p>You may require one following unfavourable mortgage valuation, Homebuyer Survey, building survey or property overview.</p>

			<p>A hardcore containing sulphate is now banned from use below floor slabs, and in any case there is now a requirement for a damp proof membrane which would prevent sulphate attack. Typically the problem houses are those built by local authorities in the 1950?s and 60?s in mining areas. This is because colliery shale, which contains sulphates, was used for hardcore.</p>

			<h2>Why might you require one? </h2>

			<p>You may require one following unfavourable mortgage valuation, Homebuyer Survey, building survey or property overview.</p>

			<p>A hardcore containing sulphate is now banned from use below floor slabs, and in any case there is now a requirement for a damp proof membrane which would prevent sulphate attack. Typically the problem houses are those built by local authorities in the 1950?s and 60?s in mining areas. This is because colliery shale, which contains sulphates, was used for hardcore.</p>

			<h2>What does a Sulphate Report entail? </h2>

			<p>A sulphate report entails breaking one or more holes through the ground floor slab and digging down to determine the hardcore thickness. A sample may then be taken for laboratory analysis.</p>

			<h2>Why might you require one? </h2>

			<p>You may require one following unfavourable mortgage valuation, Homebuyer Survey, building survey or property overview.</p>

			<p>A hardcore containing sulphate is now banned from use below floor slabs, and in any case there is now a requirement for a damp proof membrane which would prevent sulphate attack. Typically the problem houses are those built by local authorities in the 1950?s and 60?s in mining areas. This is because colliery shale, which contains sulphates, was used for hardcore.</p>

			<h2>What does a Sulphate Report entail? </h2>

			<p>A sulphate report entails breaking one or more holes through the ground floor slab and digging down to determine the hardcore thickness. A sample may then be taken for laboratory analysis.</p>

			<h2>Why might you require one? </h2>

			<p>You may require one following unfavourable mortgage valuation, Homebuyer Survey, building survey or property overview.</p>

			<p>A hardcore containing sulphate is now banned from use below floor slabs, and in any case there is now a requirement for a damp proof membrane which would prevent sulphate attack. Typically the problem houses are those built by local authorities in the 1950?s and 60?s in mining areas. This is because colliery shale, which contains sulphates, was used for hardcore.</p>

			<h2>What does a Sulphate Report entail? </h2>

			<p>A sulphate report entails breaking one or more holes through the ground floor slab and digging down to determine the hardcore thickness. A sample may then be taken for laboratory analysis.</p>

			<h2>Why might you require one? </h2>

			<p>You may require one following unfavourable mortgage valuation, Homebuyer Survey, building survey or property overview.</p>

			<p>A hardcore containing sulphate is now banned from use below floor slabs, and in any case there is now a requirement for a damp proof membrane which would prevent sulphate attack. Typically the problem houses are those built by local authorities in the 1950?s and 60?s in mining areas. This is because colliery shale, which contains sulphates, was used for hardcore.</p>

			<h2>What does a Sulphate Report entail? </h2>

			<p>A sulphate report entails breaking one or more holes through the ground floor slab and digging down to determine the hardcore thickness. A sample may then be taken for laboratory analysis.</p>

			<h2>Why might you require one? </h2>

			<p>You may require one following unfavourable mortgage valuation, Homebuyer Survey, building survey or property overview.</p>

			<p>A hardcore containing sulphate is now banned from use below floor slabs, and in any case there is now a requirement for a damp proof membrane which would prevent sulphate attack. Typically the problem houses are those built by local authorities in the 1950?s and 60?s in mining areas. This is because colliery shale, which contains sulphates, was used for hardcore.</p>

			<h2>What does a Sulphate Report entail? </h2>

			<p>A sulphate report entails breaking one or more holes through the ground floor slab and digging down to determine the hardcore thickness. A sample may then be taken for laboratory analysis.</p>

			<p>A hardcore containing sulphate is now banned from use below floor slabs, and in any case there is now a requirement for a damp proof membrane which would prevent sulphate attack. Typically the problem houses are those built by local authorities in the 1950?s and 60?s in mining areas. This is because colliery shale, which contains sulphates, was used for hardcore.</p>

			<h2>What does a Sulphate Report entail? </h2>

			<p>A sulphate report entails breaking one or more holes through the ground floor slab and digging down to determine the hardcore thickness. A sample may then be taken for laboratory analysis.</p>

			<h2>Why might you require one? </h2>

			<p>You may require one following unfavourable mortgage valuation, Homebuyer Survey, building survey or property overview.</p>

			<p>A hardcore containing sulphate is now banned from use below floor slabs, and in any case there is now a requirement for a damp proof membrane which would prevent sulphate attack. Typically the problem houses are those built by local authorities in the 1950?s and 60?s in mining areas. This is because colliery shale, which contains sulphates, was used for hardcore.</p>

			<h2>What does a Sulphate Report entail? </h2>

			<p>A sulphate report entails breaking one or more holes through the ground floor slab and digging down to determine the hardcore thickness. A sample may then be taken for laboratory analysis.</p>

			<h2>Why might you require one? </h2>

			<p>You may require one following unfavourable mortgage valuation, Homebuyer Survey, building survey or property overview.</p>

			<p>A hardcore containing sulphate is now banned from use below floor slabs, and in any case there is now a requirement for a damp proof membrane which would prevent sulphate attack. Typically the problem houses are those built by local authorities in the 1950?s and 60?s in mining areas. This is because colliery shale, which contains sulphates, was used for hardcore.</p>

			<h2>What does a Sulphate Report entail? </h2>

			<p>A sulphate report entails breaking one or more holes through the ground floor slab and digging down to determine the hardcore thickness. A sample may then be taken for laboratory analysis.</p>

			<h2>Why might you require one? </h2>

			<p>You may require one following unfavourable mortgage valuation, Homebuyer Survey, building survey or property overview.</p>

			<p>A hardcore containing sulphate is now banned from use below floor slabs, and in any case there is now a requirement for a damp proof membrane which would prevent sulphate attack. Typically the problem houses are those built by local authorities in the 1950?s and 60?s in mining areas. This is because colliery shale, which contains sulphates, was used for hardcore.</p>

			<h2>What does a Sulphate Report entail? </h2>

			<p>A sulphate report entails breaking one or more holes through the ground floor slab and digging down to determine the hardcore thickness. A sample may then be taken for laboratory analysis.</p>
